# Programming in Depth - Exercise 3 - JSON

Following exercise regards working with JSON, Javascript Object Notation. Some resources are provide in the following [links](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp), [json](https://json.org). JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format, meaning that it is used for formatting documents such that data can be exchanged between computers. These types of documents are human read- and writable. JSON documents are also easy for computers to parse and generate which means that it is compatible with many programming language. Therefore, it is suitable tool for long term storage for small applications. In this exercise youâ€™ll code an application for taking attendance. The application should run in terminal and have a text interface, similar to the project in Individual Project. The functionalities should include

1. save and load JSON files.
2. create a new attendance sheet.
3. add and delete a member for an attendance sheet.
4. take attendance for existing and new members.
5. display the previous or current taken attendance.
6. update current taken attendance.
7. display latest date of taken attendance.

All of these functionalities are active after the application is launched. It should not require a restart of the application for some of the functionalities to work. Java is the chosen programming language for this exercise. Consult with teacher or assistent if other languages are wished to be used. JSON file-example will be provide for you to load in your application. Good luck, and great job on previous exercises.
